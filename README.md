# Indifood

I have made a food ordering web application which is known as INDIFOOD.
In this project I'm using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and FIREBASE for login and register authentication purpose.
So basically it is a frontend project and i'm using firebase as a database.
After the register and login process you will enter the main website where you can see our
food menu, details and much more.

# Functionalities
